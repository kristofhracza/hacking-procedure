# Hello Fellow Humans!
This site consist of notes that will help with compromising CTF-like systems.     
The book is mainly made up of notes from Hack The Box write-ups and from some other projects on which I've been working on.

This is not a finished site. I will keep on adding information that I believe to be useful. Also, not every technique or method will be included here. These are surface-level notes that are useful. **Do not** rely on them too much!
