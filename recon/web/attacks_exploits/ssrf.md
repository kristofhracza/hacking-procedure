# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Server-Side Request Forgery** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location

# Example 1
```php
<?php
$new_page = $_GET["page"];
header("Location:   $new_page");
?>
```
Here one can just supply any URL as the `page` parameter; `http://remote.com?page=http://10.10.10.10`

It will result in a redirect to the given url.


# Example 2 (LFI)
```php
<?php  
$url = $_GET["url"];  
$content = file_get_contents($url);  
echo $content;  
?>
```
This is a normal LFI, those it can still be classified as SSRF.

One can just use a file as the `url` parameter and read it; `http://remote.com?url=/etc/passwd`
